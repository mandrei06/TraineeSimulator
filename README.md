## Overview

Our team have been asked to build a simulator which will help track the number of people currently training.

## Stage 1 requirements:

- The tracker needs to be able to track time in a consistent way.
- The program starts by asking how long the simulation will run for (for example, how many months).
- Every month, a random number of trainees are generated, wanting to be trained (50 - 100).
- Every month, Sparta Global opens training centres; they open instantly and can take trainees every month.
- A centre can train a max of 100 trainees and takes a random number of trainees every month (0 - 50 trainees up to their capacity).
- If a centre is full, trainees can be moved to any other centre which is not full.
- If all centres are full, the trainees go onto a waiting list; this list must be served first before new trainees are taken.
- At the end of the simulation, output should show:
	- number of open centres
	- number of full centres
	- number of trainees currently training
	- number of trainees on the waiting list

## Stage 2 requirements:
- Sparta will now check centres each month.
	- If a centre has fewer than 25 trainees, it will close.
	- The trainees will be randomly moved to another suitable centre.
- The simulation should now offer the choice of summary data at the end of the simulation or a running output updated each month.
- Trainees will now have a course type (Java, C#, Data, DevOps or Business); a trainee will be randomly assigned a course when they are created and this will never change.
- Sparta now has 3 different types of centre - when a new centre can be opened, one of the following will be randomly chosen:
	- Training Hub: can train a maximum of 100 trainees, but 3 (randomly 1-3) can be opened at a time each month.
	- Bootcamp: can train a maximum of 500 trainees, but can remain open for 3 months if there are fewer than 25 trainees in attendance. If a Bootcamp has 3 consecutive months of low attendance, it will close. For the lifetime of the simulation, only 2 Bootcamps can exist at a time.
	- Tech Centre: Can train 200 trainees but only teaches one course per centre. This is chosen randomly when a Tech Centre is opened.
- The simulation should report on the following:
	- number of open centres (breakdown for each type)
	- number of closed centres (breakdown for each type)
	- number of full centres (breakdown for each type)
	- number of trainees currently training (breakdown for each type)
	- number of trainees on the waiting list (breakdown for each type)

## Stage 3 requirements:
- If a trainee has been in training for 3 months, they are moved to a bench state.
- Clients will begin to be randomly created after 1 year of the simulation.
- A client will have a requirement when they are created (for example, a need for 27 Java trainees). The requirement can be any value greater than or equal to 15.
- A client will take a random number of trainees from the bench each month (1 - full requirement) until their requirement is met.
- A client will only take one type of trainee (Java, C#, Data, DevOps or Business).
- If a client does not collect enough trainees from the bench within a year, they will leave unhappy.
- If a client does collect enough trainees from the bench within a year, they will leave happy and return the next year with the same requirement.


## Output 
- At the end of the simulation the following is currently reported :
	- Number of total centres
	- Number of boot camps
	- Number of tech centers 
	- Number of Training Hub
	- number of trainees on the waiting list (breakdown for each type)
	- Number of trainees on the bench
